### **How to Play:

#### **Objective**
Survive for as long as possible against waves of enemies and get the highest score.

#### **Controls**
*   **Move:** Use `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys to move your character (the blue square).
*   **Aim:** Move your mouse to aim. A red line will show your aiming direction.
*   **Shoot:** Click the **Left Mouse Button** to shoot a bullet.

#### **Rules & Gameplay**
*   **Enemies (Green Squares):** Enemies will constantly spawn and chase you. If they touch you, you will lose health.
*   **Shooting:** You can shoot in any direction by aiming with your mouse. There is a short cooldown between shots, shown in the top-left corner.
*   **Ricochet Bullets:**
    *   Your bullets will bounce off the walls.
    *   After a bullet bounces off a wall for the first time, it will turn **red**.
    *   **BE CAREFUL!** Only these **red**, ricocheted bullets can damage you. Your own direct shots are harmless to you.
*   **Scoring:** You get **1 point** for every enemy you defeat.

#### **Game Over**
The game ends when your health runs out. You can lose health by being touched by an enemy or hit by your own ricocheted bullet. Click the screen to restart and try for a new high score
